    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups sushi rice</li>
        <li>4 nori seaweed sheets</li>
        <li>Assorted fillings (sliced raw fish, cooked shrimp, avocado, cucumber, carrots, etc.)</li>
        <li>Soy sauce, for dipping</li>
        <li>Wasabi, for serving</li>
        <li>Pickled ginger, for serving</li>
        <li>Toasted sesame seeds, for garnish</li>
        <li>Bamboo sushi mat (makisu)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the sushi rice in cold water until the water runs clear. Cook the rice according to the package instructions, using slightly less water than usual to achieve a slightly sticky texture.</li>
        <li>While the rice is cooking, prepare the fillings by slicing them into thin strips or bite-sized pieces.</li>
        <li>Once the rice is cooked, let it cool slightly. In a separate bowl, mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Pour the mixture over the cooked rice and gently fold it in, being careful not to mash the rice.</li>
        <li>Place a bamboo sushi mat on a clean surface and lay a sheet of nori seaweed on top.</li>
        <li>Wet your hands with water to prevent sticking, then take a handful of sushi rice and spread it evenly on the nori, leaving a small margin at the top and bottom.</li>
        <li>Arrange your chosen fillings in a line across the middle of the rice.</li>
        <li>Using the sushi mat, carefully roll the nori and rice over the fillings, applying gentle pressure to create a tight roll. Moisten the margin at the top with water to seal the roll.</li>
        <li>Repeat the process with the remaining nori, rice, and fillings.</li>
        <li>Once the rolls are complete, use a sharp knife to slice them into bite-sized pieces. Dip the knife in water between each slice to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Arrange the sushi pieces on a serving platter. Sprinkle toasted sesame seeds over the top for added flavor and presentation.</li>
        <li>Serve the sushi with soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger on the side. Encourage your guests to dip the sushi lightly into the soy sauce and add a small amount of wasabi or pickled ginger to enhance the flavors.</li>
        <li>Enjoy the delicious and beautiful creations of your homemade sushi!</li>
    </ol>
