    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Bibimbap is a vibrant and colorful Korean rice dish that translates to "mixed rice." It's a harmonious combination of rice, various sautéed and seasoned vegetables, marinated beef (optional), a fried egg, and a flavorful sauce. The beauty of Bibimbap lies in its diverse ingredients and the joy of mixing them together before enjoying each delicious spoonful.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons gochujang (Korean red chili pepper paste)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>4 cups cooked short-grain rice</li>
        <li>8 ounces beef (such as sirloin or ribeye), thinly sliced and marinated (optional)</li>
        <li>2 cups assorted vegetables (carrots, spinach, zucchini, mushrooms, bean sprouts, etc.), julienned or sliced</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Sesame seeds, for garnish</li>
        <li>Sliced green onions, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the gochujang, sesame oil, soy sauce, rice vinegar, sugar, and minced garlic to make the Bibimbap sauce. Set aside.</li>
        <li>If using marinated beef, cook it in a heated skillet over medium-high heat until cooked through. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the assorted vegetables and sauté them individually until cooked but still slightly crisp. Season each vegetable with a pinch of salt as you go. Transfer each cooked vegetable to a separate plate.</li>
        <li>In the same skillet, add another tablespoon of vegetable oil and fry the eggs sunny-side up or according to your preference. Set aside.</li>
        <li>To assemble the Bibimbap, divide the cooked rice among four bowls. Arrange the cooked vegetables and beef (if using) on top of the rice, leaving a space in the center for the egg.</li>
        <li>Place a fried egg in the center of each bowl.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the Bibimbap sauce over the rice and vegetables, or serve it on the side.</li>
        <li>Garnish with sesame seeds and sliced green onions.</li>
        <li>To enjoy, thoroughly mix all the ingredients together in the bowl, ensuring the sauce coats the rice and vegetables evenly.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately and savor the vibrant flavors and textures of Bibimbap!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Note: Feel free to customize your Bibimbap by adding other toppings like kimchi, sliced cucumber, or pickled radish. You can also adjust the spiciness of the sauce according to your taste preference. Enjoy this hearty and satisfying Korean dish!</p>
