    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Taiwanese Minced Pork on Rice is a classic and beloved dish that combines the simplicity of steamed rice with the rich and flavorful minced pork topping. In this recipe, ground pork is cooked to perfection with aromatic garlic and shallots, creating a savory foundation. A delightful sauce made from a blend of soy sauce, oyster sauce, Shaoxing wine, dark soy sauce, and sugar is then added, infusing the pork with a delectable umami depth. As the pork simmers in the sauce, it becomes tender and absorbs the flavors, resulting in a mouthwatering and satisfying dish. Served over fluffy steamed jasmine rice and garnished with boiled eggs and fresh green onions, this dish offers a harmonious combination of textures and tastes. With each bite, you'll experience the delightful mingling of savory, sweet, and earthy flavors that make Taiwanese Minced Pork on Rice a true comfort food favorite.</p>

    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium heat. Add minced garlic and chopped shallots. Stir-fry for 1-2 minutes until fragrant and golden.</li>
        <li>Increase the heat to medium-high and add ground pork to the skillet. Break it up with a spatula and cook until the pork is browned and cooked through.</li>

        <li>Add water to the skillet, reduce the heat to low, and let the pork simmer for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally. This will allow the flavors to meld and the sauce to thicken.</li>
        <li>While the pork is simmering, prepare steamed jasmine rice according to package instructions. Fluff the cooked rice with a fork.</li>
        <li>Once the pork sauce has thickened and reduced, remove the skillet from heat.</li>
